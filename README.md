Python Projects
This repository contains a collection of Python projects that I have completed. The projects include a rock paper scissors game, an application form, and a machine learning project.

Rock Paper Scissors Game
This project is a simple rock paper scissors game that I created using Python. The game allows the players to compete against the computer. The player who wins the most matches wins the game.

Application Form
This project is an application form that I created using Python. The form allows users to enter their personal information, such as their name, email address, and phone number. The form also allows users to select their preferred programming language.
